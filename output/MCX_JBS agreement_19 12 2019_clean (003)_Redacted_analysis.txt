Based on the provided text, it appears to be a draft of an exclusive supply agreement between JBS S.A. (the "Supplier") and a Romanian company (the "Distributor"). The agreement outlines the terms and conditions for the supply of products by the Supplier to the Distributor for distribution in specific territories.

Here are some key points and observations from the text:

1. The agreement is for exclusive supply, meaning the Distributor has the right to exclusively distribute the products in the specified territories.
2. The territories mentioned are Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Greece, and the Czech Republic.
3. The Supplier grants the Distributor the right to distribute the products in these territories, subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement.
4. The Distributor is prohibited from making active sales of the products in territories allocated to other exclusive distributors or exclusively reserved to the Supplier. However, the Distributor is allowed to make passive sales of the products in these territories.
5. The Distributor is an independent contractor and shall market and sell the products in its own company name, for its own account, and at its own risk.
6. The relationship between the Parties is solely that of supplier and buyer, and the Distributor is acting for its own account. Neither Party has the right to incur liabilities or obligations on behalf of the other Party.
7. The Distributor has the right to market the products under its own tradename, trademark, or brand, at its full and encumbered discretion.
8. The agreement appears to be a draft, as it contains comments and notes from various individuals, including [DM1], [GNP2R1], [GNP4R3], [DM5], and [GNP6R5].

Some potential issues or areas of concern with the agreement include:

1. The agreement may be unclear or ambiguous in certain sections, particularly with regards to the definition of "active sales" and "passive sales".
2. The agreement may not provide sufficient protection for the Supplier's intellectual property rights, particularly with regards to the Distributor's use of the Supplier's tradename, trademark, or brand.
3. The agreement may not provide sufficient clarity on the Distributor's obligations and responsibilities, particularly with regards to the marketing and sales of the products.
4. The agreement may not provide sufficient protection for the Distributor's interests, particularly with regards to the Supplier's ability to appoint other exclusive distributors or reserve territories for itself.

Overall, the agreement appears to be a comprehensive document that outlines the terms and conditions for the supply of products by the Supplier to the Distributor. However, it may benefit from further clarification and negotiation to ensure that both Parties are adequately protected and that the agreement is enforceable.
